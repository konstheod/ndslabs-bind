# Bind service for Labs Workbench

This is a simple bind/DNS server for use with the [Labs Workbench](https://github.com/nds-org/ndslabs-startup) service.

Labs Workbench requires wildcard DNS to access services running under the Nginx ingress controller.  For development and evaluation, we provide this simple DNS service.
